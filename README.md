# Bottle Storage Server

This is a minimal _HTTP API_ (_work in progress_) that allows you
to make use of _Google Cloud Storage_.

So far it only stores `json` and `files`.

To make use of this in your local environment you should have a
`gcloud_key.json` which you can generate from the Cloud Console.

Also you need to set the appreciate environment variables specified at
`example.env`.

_Suggestion:_ Copy `example.env` to `.env`, and then overwrite the values
in that file.

This project can be deployed as a _Google Cloud Run_ service.

## Development Instructions

First you should clone the repository with the `git clone <project-url>` command.

Make sure you have `python39` and `pipenv` installed on your system.

> to install `pipenv` execute `pip install pipenv`

Before running any python programs you should make sure you have the appropriate 
environment variables set in your `.env` file.

You can get started by copying `example.env` to `.env`, and then you should
overwrite the values at the `.env`.

 - `STORAGE_METHOD` values should be `LOCAL` or `GCLOUD` depending what kind of
 file storage method you want to use. `LOCAL` for local file system and `GCLOUD` for
 google cloud storage.
 - `STORAGE_DIR` the directory where to store the files generated by the `api` in case you use `LOCAL` in `STORAGE_METHOD`.
 - `GCLOUD_BUCKET` the bucket where to store the files generated by the `api` in case you use `GCLOUD` in `STORAGE_METHOD`.
 - `CORS_DOMAINS`, is a list of comma separated valued needed to know which origins you should accept when you are required to enforce `CORS`.

Once cloned you should execute `pipenv install`, and if this was successful you can
go ahead an run `pipenv run start` which should run a `http` server powered by
`bottle.py` at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.


# Contribute to the project

If you want to write a module that uses this project, please
name space every file in modules, routes, and docs.

Try and keep it to one file per directory.

If you are using storage, name pace your directories, and name space
your database tables manually and keep the database interface 
friendly.

And example would be `dell-warranty`
